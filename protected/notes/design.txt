**	W integrity check dashboard
***	unpaid/overpaid classes (useful for checking)
	select all the signups
	determine what it should be (scholarship, etc)
	for each signup, check that the sum of incomes for it equals what it should be
***	classes paid but not signed up
	for each income
	check that there is a signup for it
	and that it is not cancelled?
***	make sure returned checks are not deposited or delivered!
	that's really easy query, in fact it should be in validation!
***	unassigned check amounts
	that's easy, because it's already in student/_owed and elsewhere
	in fact, i could hack it in php, just go through all checks and check unassigned
	    ugly, but it'd work
***	check status/dashboard, show that they add up!
	that WHAT adds up?
***	instructors don't add up to > 100
	another easy one, that all classes instructors total 100, no more, no less
*** company integrity
	instructors with company are same as the classes they're assigned to (easy)
	checks for company are same as the classes they pay for (harder)
	instructors that don't add up to the company (class assignments)
