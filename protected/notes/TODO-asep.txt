TODO tasks for ASEP

* formatting
** the rest of the reports (like, 20 of them)!
** requirements and instructor types, make view display cleaner
     i did this, in instructor didn't i?
**	subviews for companies
       show classes, instructors, payments
          company checks paid/unpaid
		have a delivered checks screen for those guys
			pick which checks are delivered!
		actually, do it in company, which is where it belongs
	
* ui
**	redo the unpaid thing, this is ridiculous
		do this stupidity in sql
				class
				cost - income.amount for this student and class
			where this student,
				and the cost - paid is > 0!
			sort by payee
        link for new check, or assign existing check (unassigned)
	    choose existing check as option in unpaid
		an autocomplete with lists of checks with amounts still avail on them
**	deposit form
		show deposit number at top
		entered, date notes
		deposit #, date, name entered by, differt date at bottom filled
		show popup of the next one when entering
			or my summary might be OK, using echosen
			popup would be fun though.
		payer before  date in check list and _incomes
		put in check number, autocomplete
			populate the info on the check
		will need some kind of undepposited status, total amount
		either auto-enter or a button to auto enter automatically
			any checks to OSSPTO
			which are joint checks
			or which are for classes which are 50% capacity		
**	check_income
		an optional list of unpaid things to pay
			make it an autocomplete
		calculate that checks add up to their summaries
			this doesn't have to be js.
			maybe just present a list of unpaid classes?
			because that's all they'll really need anyway
		show amount - total value of current assignments
		these will ultimately need to be ajaxy
		rather then allowing it to be freeform?
		when adding check/income split,
**	autoppopulate the check when adding
		when adding WHAT?
**	in general, make menu on views like checkincome (just edit and delete)
		and maybe add ones for the others, the tab ones
**	in general, prevent entry errors, and warn if they exist
		like:
			enter a grade that is out of range
			change the date but there are active meetings
			a check or split where totals don't add up
			entering to a session not the current default
			class over capacity but student set to enrolled
			trying to delete linked tables!
				in check, for sure, but also everywhere really
		how?
			populate a js array with the data, and check it with jquery?
			in the case of classes, i can arrange them in the heir chosen
				group the classes in and out of range
			maybe just override the controller
**	make search work
		with checkboxes
		with linked tables
**	make sort work with linked subviews
		not so easy
**	will need security protection for signups-public
		rbac? oh gawd...
			
* bugfixen
**	in class/_owed, should include waitlisted!
		checks do get entered, gets put in another envelope
**	in paid, why are cancelleds payments not showing up at all?
**	on student/_income, if cancelled, show the paids,
		so find enrolled OR cancelled or just not waitlisted
**	they WERE paid. only returned checks shouldn't show up.
		or maybe they should, just not in totals?


* oh crap. how to deal with partial refunds???
	i.e. waitlist? or a cancellation of only ONE class, not all?
	or late refunds
	DO I NEED TO TRACK REFUND CHECKS?


	
* reports first! THEN DO THE UI AGAIN based on the reports. try that.



* validation/integrity checks needed
	http://www.yiiframework.com/extension/composite-unique-key-validatable/es
	splits add up! for checks, and for instructor percentages
		checks being the REALLY IMPORTANT ONE
	the student must be signed up for that class before it gets paid
	in other words, the two keys have to be dependent on each other
		an onchange validation, need to populate the other box
		and on validation, need to make sure they are signed up for the class
			before allowing them to pay for it

		
* general gui questions MUST get dealt with
	sorxting!
	searching!


* small ui things
** date/time conversions
		do it in the load_model method!
		and before save in update/create.
		that is all. no problems, no muss, no fuss.
**	finish putting datepickers in
		check expense
		check income
		deposit
		schoolcalendar
		expensse
		income


* gui conundrums wrapped in enigmas
**	clean up date and weekday formatting, using formatter in yii
		not my zhtml hack
		but beware the afterfind/beforevalidate crap!
			it could break my model start/end stuff VERY IMPORTANT!
			do it by overloading load_model and beforevalidate, instead
			BE CAREFUL!
		i could create a separate get/set that wraps it
			for every model that has dates in it. gah.
			or a wrapper that transforms them before/after manually
**	waitlist is an interesting conundrum
**	payments -> deposits
		i'll really need a pick list here!
		will need to pick the checks AT THE SAME TIME as entering
		of all payments not yet assigned to a deposit.
		how to move them to and fro?
		deposits MUST calculate out too
			there's a whole lot of reconciling that needs to go on here.
		will need a picklist of checks-not-yet-deposited
			this could be VERY easy.
			by default, a new deposit should have all of them.
	how to handle teachers who are students?
		reflextitve relation. dammit. they're not teachers of THIS
	checks get returned, she said, if they're waitlisted
		
* CLEANUP
** vital
***	trap exceptions on save,  if there's an integrity constraint!
		trap/catch errors when trying to delete linked tables
***	also trap exceptions on double-delete, it happens in ajax-land
		if the refresh isn't complete yet
***	go through and make sure all my queries and searches are session-enabled
		so i can change them later easily
        this means the popups too.
***	add an EMPTY as a default for deposit on checks!	
***	i need a wide layout with menu at top, major css/layout stuff
		it needs to be integrated into class for sure, and student
		i have it in a branch menuthrash. works with clips, nice!
***	use either breadcrumbs or returnto, but be consistent!
		breadcrumbs is cleaner than returnto, but will it work?
***	make edit button on reports an optional item, only if logged in
	
** useful
***	default sort/scope for everytbing
    search and such
***	manually edit dates, in m/d/y format
***	try to get rid of the echosen version of jquery! NO DUPES!
***	today button, fix
***	make company id 1  not editable or removable (company form/view)
***	autocompletes not dropdowns
		students
		classes
		roster import
***	make the signup and received papework dates default to today on create
		js? or controller? i think it is easy, in controller prolly
***	trap exception on populate for school days
***	to avoid confusion, special case the company stuff
		if company is not PTO, or is type company, show delivered, not deposited
			else  show deposited, not delivered
		if instructor type is company, show the company popup
			else hide company popup
		if is not company, don't show company popup at all
		javascript in forms, something else in view
***	new student wizard really. ajaxy: class->student->import->signup
***	new on pulldowns!! so new instructor at end of pulldown for instructor
***	now make the save() actions check breadcrumbs, not returnto
***	take out the key columns from linktable forms-- one-sided not 2-sided
		if i stick with those, if i don't replace them with something else
		have to know which way i came in, that's the critical part.
			by GET maybe?

** cosmetic
***	use the roster as the template for any index views, i have the css nice
***	a nice jui popup when hovering over a cell, showing description!
***	year bump buttons on the expired and received datepickers
		didn't i do that already?
***	signupsheet
		strikethrough for cancelled
		color/gray for waitlist?
***	dependent date/timepickers, i.e. start/end intelligently
***	the goddamned times are wrong, they're not in am/pm time! they don't convert
		this is the timepicker brokenness, fix it
***	generate the signup form via PDF library, on the fly	

* STUCK
** open questions
***	how do you know who to write the check to (from that report)?
***	deleting/cancelling a class
***	returning a check! do you just delete it?
***	cost PER class? extra costs? total cost? how?
***	will you have a case where the materials fee is NOT PER CLASS
		i.e. per year?


** student payment status, i.e. enrollment with payment status
** ok, forms starting to make sense
	for adding a check from student or class, DO NOT NEED TO SPLIT IT
		hell, i alredy know the student, class, AND amount! 
		just a single line, try cform builder!
		and, i can not bother with a popup for check
		hell, i can have an ajax popup for splits.
			make that form optional for create, but NOT optional for editing
	for adding payment through class or instructor, do NOT probably need it.
		ask heidi about that one tho. maybe redirect for now.
	for adding check through checks, put a tabular input!
		keep it simple. js to add/remove rows.
	for adding a payment through checks, will need tabular input
	for adding a STUDENT to a class, just do one form with both models!
		what if the students are already in there? it's just a signup.
			most will be.
			if not, then an entry?
** finish the relational mappings
***	a way to create/edit/save a dependent model with ONE field in relation
		or a FEW maybe
		use tom__'s stuff i think
		a common pattern, for a few important things
			income
			expense
			signup
			instructorassignmeent
			requirementstatus
***	gui splits for income/expense
		for now handle it like instructors
			but the data entry would be way too complicated that way
		

* FUTURE REQUIRD
** must have for NEXT SESSION!
***	for setting session, for now, just a simple non-ajax screen, nothing fancy
		then i have to start using it in queries. named scope, seems right.
		the big issue will be all the dropdowns, which use findAll()
			i should start constraining those by session!
			use named scope, it's easy, default scope is session now!
		searches also, need to use the named scope or something
***	how to import/add new class from previous session
		an ajaxything or something, a popup
		relational deep copy! only a few tables though:
		 	instructors, it'll need to create new joins for them. just them!
			and extra fees
			not students though. until parents sign them up! or income.
***	delete a class
		first fix the link, it's not a-werken (missing js?)
		only delete class is no students signed up
		do not let them delete otherwise
		DO automatically delete all the dates and instructors
		delete from instructor_assignment where class_id=:cid
		delete from class_meeting where class_id=:cid
		delete from class_info where id=:cid



** must have for NEXT YEAR:
***	need some way to track the current school year. 
		yes, i remember now!!!! it took today's date, calculated month!
		so based on where you were in the calendar, you were this year or next
		aha, i think it will be a named scope
***	picklist of STUDENTS could get huge, and need to be pared down
		how to determine when kids are no longer in ocean shore??
		um, graduate them? when updating grades, if grade > 8, remove
		current flag?
		also, grade needs to be updated every year somehow
***	i will DEFINITELY need some kind of de-duping system
		like i had to do for the coop. it'll have to happen.



* FOR NON-ADMIN USER LOGIN
** future/with user login security
	let instructors edit descriptions
		


* BELOW THE LINE
** maybe make location a link column, not let them be in same place

** try editable datatable!
	go back and replace many_many and advanced with has_many and with-related
		requirementtype
		instructortype

** make a validation rule to make sure that the instructors aren't getting > 100 % !!
	i.e. check to see if a class has > 100% total

	in the some popup (chosen?), the # is breaking stuff
		i decided not to use it, so this is below the line for now

** have a checkbox on income page to select which classes to pay

** visual show/add meeting dates
	a very quick datepicker adder!
	just a date, not hidden, and boom, it adds, maybe even ajaxy.
	in the meetingdates, join to school calendar and show that stuff!
